Hello! My name is Hakan Dingenc, and I am interested in the realm of [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security) and applications of [programming language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory) to it.

I am currently on a break from my master's degree in computer science at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu). Previously, I earned a Bachelor's of Science in [computer science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) and [mathematics](https://www.math.northwestern.edu) from Northwestern University. Things I am interested in include network security, internet security, digital forensics and incident response, threat hunting, penetration testing, binary analysis, exploit development, modern and post-quantum cryptography, program analysis, mathematical logic, information theory, coding theory, formal verification, and language-based security.

I usually code in [C++](https://isocpp.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

In my free time, I work on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/h0d1n), [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.eu/profile/694727), and [security certifications](https://www.credly.com/users/hakan-dingenc). I also listen to classical music, play the flute, and read about human psychology and metacognition. Occasionally, I spend time on practicing my French.

Some quotes I have gathered over time: [Â§Quotes](quotes.html)
